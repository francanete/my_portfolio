          <p>
            I'm Fran Canete, frontend developer, business enthusiast and
            lifelong learner based in Manchester.
          </p>
          <p>
            Passionate about how businesses can create useful solutions to
            improve people's lives. I find learning and implementing new
            technologies a fantastic tool to achieve this goal, creating new web
            applications that solve real-life problems.
          </p>
          <p>
            Most of my projects are based on React.js since it is one of the
            best technologies to build rich UI that allow me to build powerful
            customer-centric solutions. I also spend part of my time expanding
            my skills learning backend technologies like Node.js and Express.js
            with the long-term goal of becoming a full-stack developer able to
            design powerful applications from the ground up.
          </p>
          <p>
            In my spare time, you can find me taking long walks in nature,
            running, and enjoying one of my favourite hobbies, podcasting.
